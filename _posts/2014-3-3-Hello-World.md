This blog has been written using Markdown and the rather spiffy looking  [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.

I'm not sure whether the edit style etc will suit me  but it has to be said the set up was incredibly easy. Fork the repo, rename the repo and it's done. Amazing.
